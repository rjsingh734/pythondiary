# _Variables, expressions, and statements_
+ #### Values and types  
A value is one of the basic things a program works with, like a letter or a number.  
Examples of values are 1, 3.14, and "Hello, World!"

These values belong to different types: **1** is an integer, **3.14** is an float(these numbers are represented in a format called floating point.), and **"Hello, World!"** is a string(it contains a "string" of letters. You can identify strings because they are enclosed in quotation marks.)
